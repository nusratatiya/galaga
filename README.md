# Galaga

Term project for CSCI0390: Spatial Agent-Based Modeling at Middlebury College

The Galaga Netlogo implementation is a simplified version of the 1981 fixed shooter game, Galaga. The player is tasked with destroying the Galaga enemies while also avoiding projectiles before losing its lives.

## Description

The game uses turtle agents as breeds for the playable user, lasers, and enemies, as well as patch assignments that facilitate the behavior of the turtle agents. 

To begin gameplay, a level must be selected, of which are ordered based on difficulty. Once a level is selected, the user should select the ‘setup’ button to generate the playing plane, along with all relevant turtle agents and patch formations. Then click the 'go' button to officially begin the game.
